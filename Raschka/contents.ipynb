    "Below is a list of the topics I am planning to cover. Note that while these topics are numerated by lectures, note that some lectures are longer or shorter than others. Also, we may skip over certain topics in favor of others if time is a concern. While this section provides an overview of potential topics to be covered, the actual topics will be listed in the course [calendar](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~sraschka/teaching/stat453-ss2020/#calendar) at the bottom of the course website.\n",
